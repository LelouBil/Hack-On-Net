# Hack-On-Net
This is a fan-made MP mod for Hacknet. 

### **Note**:

This mod is currently under development and a WIP. This mod is currently not in a playable state yet so this should not be used until it reaches a playable state. The beta will begin in about a month (no guarantee if this is the case) and should be playable but with a few bugs at the time.

# Installation
This is just preparation for the beta. Please do not use this yet, the releases tab is empty at this time.

- Extract all of the Pathfinder binary files into the directory containing Hacknet.exe (goto game properties in Steam, goto the local tab, and click browse local files)
